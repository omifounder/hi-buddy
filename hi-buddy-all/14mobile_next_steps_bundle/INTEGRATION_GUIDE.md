Integration & Next Steps Guide
==============================

1) Replace placeholder SER model:
   - Train a real SER model (train_ser_small.py is a toy example).
   - Convert to TFJS with convert_to_tfjs.sh.
   - Place converted files under www/models/ser/ (model.json + *.bin).

2) Use mel_spectrogram.js or mel_extractor (Meyda) to compute mel inputs that match model training preprocessing.
   - Example usage in client:
       const { melSpectrogram } = computeMelSpectrogram(floatSamples, sampleRate, {frameSize:1024, hopSize:512, melBins:64});
       // reshape/normalize as required, then pass into tf.tensor([...], [1,128,64,1])

3) Build React PWA and Capacitor wrapper:
   - Copy web assets into capacitor_project/www and run npx cap copy
   - Open Android Studio/Xcode to complete native build and signing.

4) CI/CD:
   - Use the provided GitHub Actions workflows to automate web build and capacitor copy steps.
   - iOS builds require manual signing; provide certificates/secrets in secure vaults.

Security & Privacy:
- Ensure user consent before sending audio/video to cloud.
- Consider encrypting local model files if required by policy.
